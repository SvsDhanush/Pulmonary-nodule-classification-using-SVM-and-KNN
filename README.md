# Pulmonary-nodule-classification-using-SVM-and-KNN
The development of automated pulmonary nodules detection and classification algorithms has received a lot of attention. In this project we try to classify the pulmonary nodules using SVM and KNN algorithms. We have used LIDC-IDRI dataset and its subset LUNA16 which is available in kaggle for this project.

The repo constains two ipynb files, one contains the implementation for both SVM and KNN and other contains SVM implementation which is also available on kaggle. (Note dont forget to add the data to your project before using)

Below is the kaggle link for the dataset.

Below is the link for kaggle notebook which conatins SVM implmentation.
